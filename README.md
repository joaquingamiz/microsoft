Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share Kusto Query Language (KQL) analytic rules and playbooks to enhance security and automation in Microsoft Azure environments and other cloud services.

This repository is designed for cybersecurity professionals, SOC analysts, and anyone interested in improving threat detection and response using KQL and playbooks.
